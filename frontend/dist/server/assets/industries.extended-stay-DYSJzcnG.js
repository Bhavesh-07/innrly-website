var faqs = [
	{
		q: "How does Innrly handle multi-month folio revenue recognition?",
		a: "Long stays (30, 60, 90+ days) are recognized by night, not by check-out. Revenue, taxes, and fees post to the period each night belongs to, so a 60-day stay that spans two months splits cleanly across both monthly P&Ls without manual adjustment."
	},
	{
		q: "Does Innrly's labor model handle weekly housekeeping?",
		a: "Yes. MPOR benchmarks, schedule templates, and variance alerts are tuned to weekly tidies and full cleans rather than daily — the default cadence assumed by most labor tools breaks extended-stay productivity numbers."
	},
	{
		q: "What about direct-bill corporate accounts?",
		a: "Direct-bill A/R reconciles nightly. Contract rates audit against the folio, project rates flag against negotiated terms, and A/R aging produces a clean monthly statement per corporate account without three separate spreadsheets."
	},
	{
		q: "Which extended-stay brands does Innrly support?",
		a: "All major brand families — Marriott (Residence Inn, TownePlace, Element), Hilton (Homewood Suites, Home2 Suites), IHG (Staybridge Suites, Candlewood Suites), Choice (WoodSpring, MainStay, Suburban), and Wyndham (Hawthorn Suites). Multi-brand portfolios consolidate into one nightly P&L."
