		q: "Which select-service PMSes does Innrly support?",
		a: "OPERA Cloud, OnQ (Hilton), FOSSE (Marriott), choiceADVANTAGE, Visual Matrix, StayNTouch, and Cloudbeds — plus most other major systems. Most multi-brand portfolios run 3–5 PMSes and Innrly consolidates them into a single nightly P&L without forcing a system change."
	},
	{
		q: "Will Innrly work for a single Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express?",
		a: "Yes — Starter is built for single properties and small portfolios. The bigger wins compound at 5+ hotels (consolidated reporting, multi-PMS night audit, corporate-team leverage), but single-property select-service operators still save 5–10 hours per week."
	},
	{
		q: "How does Innrly handle brand-required reporting?",
		a: "Brand-mandated reports (Hilton, Marriott, IHG, Choice, Wyndham) stay where they are — Innrly doesn't replace them. It sits on top, normalizes the data, and produces the cross-brand corporate view your flag reports don't give you."
	},
	{
		q: "What's the typical onboarding timeline for a select-service portfolio?",
		a: "2–4 weeks for a 5–15 property portfolio. Week 1: PMS and accounting connections. Week 2: chart of accounts mapping and night-audit dry run. Weeks 3–4: parallel running and corporate report sign-off. No PMS migration required."
