var faqs = [
	{
		q: "Does Innrly support USALI 11th edition out of the box?",
		a: "Yes. The default chart of accounts ships USALI-aligned with departmental P&Ls, schedule of operated departments, and the supporting reconciliations auditors and ownership groups expect. No re-mapping work required at onboarding."
	},
	{
		q: "How does Innrly handle F&B and banquet reconciliation?",
		a: "POS integrations (Micros Simphony, Toast, Squirrel) push outlet-level F&B revenue and covers into Innrly nightly. Banquet event orders reconcile to the PMS and catering system, and variances surface the next morning instead of at month-end."
	},
	{
		q: "What about resort fees, spa, golf, and parking revenue?",
		a: "All ancillary revenue streams are first-class — separate departmental P&L lines, separate labor tracking, and separate reconciliation against the source system (spa management, golf POS, parking system)."
	},
	{
		q: "Can Innrly handle a single full-service property, or do I need a portfolio?",
		a: "Single property is fine. A standalone full-service hotel or resort typically saves 20–40 controller hours per month and recovers 0.5–2% of F&B revenue through reconciliation. Portfolio operators add multi-property consolidation on top."
